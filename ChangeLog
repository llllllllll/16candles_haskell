	* ChangeLog: Added ChangeLog.
	* Makefile: Added Makefile.
	* TODO: Added TODO.
	* Compiler.hs: Removed redundant `liftM (||) ...` call. Better output
	for the case when no arguments are passed. Changed help output string.

	* Compiler/Bytecode.hs: I moved the reverse from after
	function to before. This fixes jmp resolutions from counting bytes AFTER
	the call to counting bytes before. This now makes jmp resolution work
	properly.

	* Compiler/Data.hs: Added custom show instances so the error output
	doesn't expose or rely on knowledge of the internal data representation.
	This will now change things like 'MemReg R0' to '*r0', like it would
	appear in the source code.

2014-03-23 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* Compiler/Data.hs: Added new data types and definitions for the when
	and unless commands.
	* Compiler/Lexer.hs: Added new lexing rules for braces and the 2 new
	operations.
	* Compiler/Bytecode.hs: Added new bytecode translation rules for braces,
	when, and unless.
