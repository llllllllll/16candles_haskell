A second compiler for 16candles, this time in Haskell for that sweet sweet
static typing...

16candles
---------

16candles is a 16 bit 16 register virtual machine written in c.
This compiler will compile the language defined in the 16candles project
into the bytecode that the machine accepts. For more information, see
